# CITIC SOC Agent

Self-contained SOC operations agent built on DeepSeek Harness. The repository
contains the application, SOC packages, investigation skills, Python MCP
server, and pinned harness source.

## Repository layout

- `apps/soc-agent` — application host, policy, scheduler, and MCP server
- `packages` — SOC client, scheduler, and tenant-isolated memory packages
- `vendor/deepseek-harness` — JavaScript workspace and web runtime
- `skills` — SOC operating playbooks
- `docs` — project structure and operating notes

## First-time setup

From the repository root, run:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The setup process collects missing configuration, installs dependencies, builds
the harness, and wires the SOC product into the web profile. Use
`./setup.sh --check` to audit the installation without changing it.

## Update from GitHub

Keep the checkout clean, then run:

```bash
./update.sh
```

The update script fast-forwards the current branch from its configured
upstream and runs `setup.sh --plugins` to refresh dependencies, builds, and
profile wiring. It never stashes or discards local changes. If the web app is
already running, restart it manually after the update.

To start the web app:

```bash
cd vendor/deepseek-harness
pnpm dsh web --no-open
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3080`, or use an SSH tunnel for remote access:

```bash
ssh -L 3080:127.0.0.1:3080 usr@ip
```

Runtime configuration and data, including `.env`, `.data`, PostgreSQL, and
`~/.dsh`, are kept outside Git and preserved during updates.

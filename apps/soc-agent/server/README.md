# Splunk + Zimbra MCP server

Python MCP backend for the Splunk + Zimbra Analyst product bundle. See the
[project structure](../../../docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) for workspace commands
and dependency boundaries.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
uv sync --extra test
uv run unified-mcp-server
uv run pytest
```

Standalone MCP clients should set `cwd` to this directory and pass `MCP_SERVER_ROOT` when workspace data lives elsewhere (for example the repository root `.data/` directory). The former misspelling `MCP_SEVER_ROOT` remains accepted for compatibility.

Splunk event outputs keep complete events within a 20,000-character budget and
report truncation explicitly; request selected `fields` when narrowing is
needed. Zimbra supports bounded metadata/body pagination, header-only evidence,
attachment hashes, and verified reversible message moves. The authenticated
email webserver exposes subscription listing, preview, creation, updates, and
deletion. Sends, moves, folders, filters, detection changes, and subscription
mutations remain approval-gated by the host.
